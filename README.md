# CHROMATIC

## Project Description

Chromatic is an application that allows users to experience color as sound. Using the eyedropper tool, users can select colors from an image and play an associated musical note. Users can then create their own color palette and play the associated notes collectively as a chord or sequentially.

Users who decide to sign up for an account can also upload their own images, save their favorite color palettes, and retrieve them for later use.

## Problem Domain & Solution

Inspired by colorblind Spanish-Irish cyborg artist Neil Harbisson (<a href = "https://vimeo.com/118166526">"Hearing Colors"</a>), CHROMATIC is a resource for colorblind people to experience color with their own senses. Beyond that, it's a resource for all of us to engage with entirely new dimensions of sound and color, shining a light on the richness and complexity that we might take for granted in the world around us.
